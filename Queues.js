// --- Queues ---

// Linear collection of nodes that adds (enqueues) to the tail and removes (dequeues) from the head

// Think of an line at the bank or an amusement park. First come first serve (FIFO)

// IMPLEMENTATION 
// Use a LL as the underlying Data Structure. Front of queue is tail, back is head
// Requires reference to the head and tail nodes. All other modification disallowed (i.e. cant add to middle)
