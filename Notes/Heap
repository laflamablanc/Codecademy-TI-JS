Heaps are another variation of the tree data structure and are adept at keeping track of 
the maximum or minimum value held within, referred to as max-heaps and min-heaps, respectively. 
Specifically, heaps are a type of binary tree, since each child node is either greater or less than 
its parent (depending on if itâ€™s a max-heap or min-heap). They are efficient for accessing the root value, 
which will either be the max or min (again, depending on the type of heap) and inserting new values.

--Heap Representations--

Min-heaps are binary trees. Each node has at most 2 children
Nodes are added from left to right until we've filled the entire level

-- Adding an element: Heapify Up --
Sometimes you add a node that violates the heap property (ex: smaller value than parent in a min-heap)
To fix you must "Heapify Up" which means move that added node up in the heap until it is no longer
smaller than its parent value.
If there are no parents left, that means we've moved the node all the way up to the top of the tree
and it will now become the root node (meaning its the smallest value in the whole tree).

--Removing and Element: Heapify Down--
If you want to remove the minimum value in a min-head (the root), you can't remove it directly
because it would leave potentially both of its children orphaned. Instead, we swap it with the bottow row's
rightmost child since that node will always be child-free. Then, we can remove the root node. 
However, this now leaves our heap all out of order, so we must "Heapify Down" and send the new root node 
downward in the heap until it is no longer larger than its children.
