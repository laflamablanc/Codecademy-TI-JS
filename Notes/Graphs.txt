Graphs are the perfect data structure for medeling networks. 

-- Intro -- 
They are composed of nodes (vertices) which hold data, and edges which are a connection between 2 vertices.
examples of graphs:
- Maps with connection points between locations
- Socail networks with friendships connecting people
- Wireless networks with connections between computers and routers

-- To Connect or Not to Connect -- 
The highers the ratio of edges to vertices, the more connection in the graph

If two vertices do not have an edge between them, the graph is disconnected

Edges default behavior is bi-directional, meaning if you can travel from NodeA to NodeB, you can also
travel from NodeB to NodeA.
