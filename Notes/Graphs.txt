Graphs are the perfect data structure for medeling networks. 

They are composed of nodes (vertices) which hold data, and edges which are a connection between 2 vertices.
examples of graphs:
- Maps with connection points between locations
- Socail networks with friendships connecting people
- Wireless networks with connections between computers and routers
